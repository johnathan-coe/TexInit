# TeXInit

A simple GUI for generating TeX boilerplate.

The application pulls snippets from the 'Classes', 'Packages' and 'Samples'
folder, allowing the user to select those applicable. Creation
of a document will assemble these into a .tex file.

## Snippet creation
Code snippets are provided, but addition of a new one is trivial.
Snippets should consist of a comment line, describing its functionality,
followed by code to include.

## Dependencies
- Tkinter - included in a standard Python distribution.
- The "Poppins" font - Easily substituted for another available font through editing 'style.py'
